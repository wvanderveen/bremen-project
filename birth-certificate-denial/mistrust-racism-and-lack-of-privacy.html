The street that you write for them: that is where your Papa is, that is where your Mama is. Apart from going to your father&#x27;s house to meet with your father and mother and speak with them.

Is she still married?’ (...) Crazy!

Also coming back to <span data-tippy-content="Standesamt is the German term for county clerk&#x27;s office (US) or registry office." class="tooltip">Standesamt</span> <em>— Standesamt</em>, you know, it will especially women who are involved, you know, there are a lot private things that they interfere, that they don&#x27;t have right to ask, but they will ask women about all these private things, you know. Also like, investigation — investigation, you know, is not only here but also going back to your home country, you know. So, there are some women, you know, who maybe they don&#x27;t have a good connection with their family before they left. It is not all the women, even the boys — it&#x27;s difficult when you leave. Your mother will say ‘no’ or your father. When it comes to women this is different, so, I would say for boys, it is easier to ask your parents that, ‘I want to go.’ They accept it than a woman because a woman when you say ‘I want to go to this far,’ they will say ‘This is not a journey of a woman.’ So, maybe, you know, you have this contact, you have this conflict with your family because they said... no. When they are doing this investigation, you know, so, this investigation can reveal all those secrets. You know, so, we come to marriage, you know, so, they will be really interested whether you are married, you know, in Africa or you are not married. Maybe your lifetime in Africa, you are married you know as a bad memories that you never want to remember. So, but you don&#x27;t have a chance, you have to explain whether you are married or not, you know, and also divorced. So, whether you are divorced or you are not. Okay, and also the father of your child, you know. I think this, the father of your child also, you know, somehow you know is a woman&#x27;s private life. Whether she want to present the father of your child or not, you know? So, but for the black women, you know I think — you must, you must present the father of your child whether you are married with him or you are not. And also this evidence, you know, the evidence that they will live from — for me, I see these are privacies that you know maybe you don&#x27;t want to submit, you know, but because they need it, you know or you must have to submitted, you know, so.”</div>

Because many people don&#x27;t even know how I live in Europe. Sometimes when they call we greet and they don&#x27;t even care how you live, or your background or whether you are even living. Nobody care, but now, you are now going back to go and expose me to the friends and family. Those who are called friends, many of them might be an unfriendly friend and they are going to expose the woman: this is the lifestyle that she is living in Europe. I see it like a betrayal. Yeah, I see it as exposing the woman to the world, because the person you talked to you don&#x27;t even know who is going to carry from that call.

One, two, three and you are not married?’</span> I said, ‘For your correction: my two children, my first two children, they are twins. I had a twin in one pregnancy. Then I have my daughter after the twin.’ ‘So, how can you say you are not married?’ I said, ‘I am not married. Look at the father of my child here, we have this child together, but we are not married. But we have a child together.’ She said, ‘Okay, and for the man — I don&#x27;t doubt.’ The man was even asking him, ‘Okay, can you give me a proof that you are not married?’ So, she was: ‘Does it mean that this man you had the three children for doesn&#x27;t have relationship with your family?’ The man I had these children for, that is in presence of this other man now, the man that you have this children for — does this mean that this man doesn&#x27;t have relationship with your family? I said, ‘Of course. If I dated him for a while, before we had these children together and maybe we were together but we thought we will get married if it works but if it doesn&#x27;t work you back out, you don&#x27;t have to kill yourself there.’ I said, ‘So we are together.’ So, you have dated the man one year, two years, three years, your parent does not know him, it is not correct. You are wrong. My parents know him, they knew themselves, they actually — normally what we do at our place, if you are dating with somebody you could introduce the person to your parents. This is the man I want to be with. I am with this man. You know, maybe later, we will come and get married, then you go. And in some cultures, they don&#x27;t even believe in marriage before children, before having children. You can have as many children as you want to have and then you can later come and officially do the marriage — that is pay the bride price of this person...The woman was putting it in my mouth — ‘I put it on you that you have must been married to this man.’ I said, ‘Well, the only thing I did was that I introduced this man to my family. We met, we sat down together. I introduce to my family, so my family know him.’ For me to say I dated somebody, we were friends and I have a child or children for him and my family does not know him, I cannot be saying the truth. I said my family know him. He knows my family members. But along the line, it didn&#x27;t work so everybody parts ways here, but we have these children. These children have their life.”</div>

        <p class="paragraph-small-light">This website is the outcome of a collaboration between four activists of Together We Are Bremen and two researchers of the University of Bayreuth. The project was funded by the German Research Foundation (<a href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/409314830" aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" class="link-2-light">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant #SCHR 981/10-2</a>). The website development and design was carried out by <a href="https://williamvanderveen.com/" aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" class="link-2-light">William VanderVeen</a> with support from <a href="https://www.unnatishukla.com/" aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" class="link-2-light">Unnati Shukla</a>. Felix Schramm from <a href="https://ag-prop.com/" aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" class="link-2-light">ag-prop</a> supported and advised us throughout the website development process. Our workshops took place at <a href="https://lidicehaus.de/de/home" aria-hidden="true" target="_blank" class="link-2-light">LidiceHaus</a> in Bremen.</p>

        <div class="footerheader">Donate</div>
        <p class="paragraph-small-light">Together We Are Bremen needs regular donations, to help them to continue self-organization and the struggles for the right to stay and against racism in Bremen. You can donate to a private account or to the account of the association BreSoC (BremenSolidarityCenter). You can donate to the private account in case you don&#x27;t need a receipt for your taxes. For TWAB, the private account means less administrative requirements. Send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@togetherwearebremen.org" class="link-2-light">contact@togetherwearebremen.org</a> or send them a message on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TogetherWeAreBremen/" target="_blank" class="link-2-light">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/together_we_are_bremen/" target="_blank" class="link-2-light">Instagram</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreBremen" target="_blank" class="link-2-light">Twitter</a> for the account information.</p>
