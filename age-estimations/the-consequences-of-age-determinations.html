              <div class="paragraph-light">A: “I will first start with the age and the effects that age determination has. For example, when you come here, to Bremen, when you are a minor and in the process in which you are not accepted as a minor, you are forced to accept that you are an adult. There are different effects it has on you. The first one is the accommodation. Mostly, if you are a minor, you are not accommodated in the <span data-tippy-content="Lager is a German term for camp." class="tooltip">Lager</span>, in the big camps. You are taken into a very good system. And when you compare that to the adult system, you have a better accommodation — not crowded, you mostly have your own flat, you can cook for yourself. But when you are an adult, you are mostly taken to a big camp where you don&#x27;t have the chance to cook for yourself, where you don&#x27;t have the chance to have your own space. You know, you live in a big house, with...maybe four, five, seven people in one room. And you cannot cook. You have to eat from the canteens, you don&#x27;t have the chance to eat the food you want. That is one part of it, the accommodation. And the other part is education. Like, when you are an adult, your chances of education are very limited. Like, you cannot go to a normal school, you cannot go to schools. I don&#x27;t know exactly but there is an age. When you pass that age, you cannot go to normal schools. People with whom I came here together, who are accepted as minors, in the youth system, they go to school. You know, one or two years, they get their <em>Abschluss </em>and they have their <em>Ausbildung</em>. They are faster than people who are adults. Adults mostly go to <em>Deutschkurs </em>or you go to <span data-tippy-content="BIQ is an educational programme in Bremen." class="tooltip">BIQ</span><em> </em>(This is also a really important educational project). But also this: you get <em>B1 </em>and you don&#x27;t have school <em>Abschluss</em>...So, the inequality or the disparity, when you look at education, is very wide. When you are a minor, you get the chance to get an education but when you are an adult, you get very little chance of getting an education. There is one example, someone I know who was given 40 years — that means he was assessed to be 40 years in his age determination. When he tried to register as a minor, he was given 40 years. And he could not go to any school, he could not do anything, because the maximum age for <em>BIQ </em>is 27. If you are more than 27, you cannot go to that school.” Q: “He got 40, they told him he was 40?” A: “Yes. And that is the education part. But, you also look at other parts, you know in sports and other things. When you are an adult and you want to do sports, the chances are really limited. It is different from the system for minors! Really different! And when you are a minor, you know, you get <em>Ausweis</em>, you know, you can move freely, you can go to clubs, you know. Socially also, there is a big difference. When you are an adult and you are not in the system, you have big uncertainty in your life. Also in Bremen, if you are categorized as an adult, you have also the risk of being transferred outside of Bremen. And also when you are transferred, you go for asylum. When you go for asylum, this will take you also to other categories, whether you are qualified to get asylum or not, also the <span data-tippy-content="The so called Dublin regulation states that an asylum request by an adult migrant must be processed by the first EU country that the migrant entered.

When interviewees mention Dublin, they mean the possible deportation to Italy due to the Dublin regulations." class="tooltip">Dublin</span> regulations and other stuff are coming to this. So it is very big and the opportunities are very vast and it is a big difference here.”</div>

              <div class="paragraph-light">“So, what do people do when they do age estimations? They go to the machine where the machine looks at the bones and the teeth, Or they go to the <span data-tippy-content="When our interviewees speak of the Social, they often refer to the Youth Welfare Services." class="tooltip">Social</span>. They are asked: ‘Where are you coming from, when did you go to school, why did you come?’ and so on. And the <em>Social </em>checks if somebody has wrinkles or something. They say it is for determining age. But in the end, what it comes down to is this: <span class="emphasis-in-quote">It is not about determining age. But it&#x27;s determining <em>where </em>a person lives, <em>how </em>a person lives, <em>if </em>a person lives, survives, dies, hopes, shatters</span>, and so on. It is weird that they come from bones and teeth and wrinkles and ‘when did you go to school?’ or whatever to life, ways of living and survival, and so on. This is important for me because I really always think: ‘Why are they talking about age? It is not about age.’ So I gathered all the stories that came to my mind from our research. T gave his passport to the <span data-tippy-content="The Migrationsamt is Bremen&#x27;s foreigners registration office (commonly referred to as Ausländerbehörde in other German states)." class="tooltip">Migrationsamt</span>, and if he goes there to get his passport, he gets deported. M&#x27;s age got rejected and was told: ‘Ah, by the way, you can also be deported to Italy at any moment’. H, who I interviewed just two weeks ago, also got his age rejected and like a few days later he sent me his deportation notice. He was told to go back to Lithuania because he came over Belarus. Then I was thinking about I. who has come from Ukraine and I am actually not sure if he would be deported back to Ukraine, I don&#x27;t know because I am not sure if they are part of the <span data-tippy-content="The so called Dublin regulation states that an asylum request by an adult migrant must be processed by the first EU country that the migrant entered. In case of our interviewees, this first country often was Italy. When interviewees mention Dublin, they mean the possible deportation to Italy due to the Dublin regulations." class="tooltip">Dublin</span> system, but I mean he went away from there because his friends were killed there. Three friends were killed there, so, it&#x27;s really dangerous there for Black people. And he got rejected here. And there is B, there is L, and there are many stories that we have. And another friend actually got deported and then worked on the farms in Italy, living homelessly in these weird kinds of plastic tents and farming food for Europeans. And I just thought about that today, I thought about this before but we were speaking in the interviews, it is a lot about food in the camps, you know. You don&#x27;t get proper food, you don&#x27;t get enough food. Food is such an issue and then if you get deported, you are making, farming for those Europeans who then deny you good food in the camps. I am thinking with Gift&#x27;s analysis that she made before. I think her formulation that Birth certificates are like a key is very good. And I thought age determination is also something like that. I am not sure what it is: whether it is a key or a door or a border or all of these, but something like that. Something that is really putting people from one place to the other.”</div>

If you ask for asylum after your 18th birthday, you might have to go back to Italy. And because of that, there are these questions about under 18 or over 18. That means that deportations of minors are more or less impossible for Germany. And because of that, they argue on this point and this question of if somebody is over or under 18. On this question the whole chances for the person change. For our clients, it&#x27;s a question for many of them it is a question of life. Will you be deported away from Europe or not? And even for this, for the minors, it is ‘hop or top’. It&#x27;s often not the question of how big is the chance to win this case but it is always ‘Just try anything.’ But if the <em>Ausländerbehörde</em> and the authorities are sure that somebody is a minor they give them better chances than anyone else.”</div>

One early morning they took me to an office, I found a lady there and she explained me everything like: ‘You are still in the system in Italy but you are here, you are a minor at this point, because <span data-tippy-content="When our interviewees speak of the Social, they often refer to the Youth Welfare Services." class="tooltip">Sozial</span> does not decide whether you are a minor or not. So you&#x27;ll be here, up to when they approve that you are a minor. When they approve that you are a minor, you will stay. But when they approve that you are an adult, they may send you back to Italy. So that was confusion yet again. So after my bone test, <span class="emphasis-in-quote">on the day I was picking my bone test in <em>Social</em>, the woman who was giving me the result told me that ‘You can be deported to Italy at the next point.</span> I cannot exactly say the date when they&#x27;ll send you back, but you can be sent back at the next point.’ So that was a mixed feeling for me at that point. So another challenge come — I have this <em>Dublin</em>, then, they reject my age. At that point, I do not know what to do. It was really a tough time. At that point, I was even telling my friends: ‘Before sending me back to Italy, they should send me back to my country, Gambia. That is better’. Because I know the life I was living in Italy. I was able to abandon that place and come here for a better living....so going back to my country is better than going to Italy, because it was crazy. I was having trauma at that time.”</div>

Would that change anything?” A: “When they reject you, they tell you that you can&#x27;t stay here, because they only allow minors to stay here. So you cannot stay in Bremen, they only take minors. It is like that. They give you this information, that the only way to stay here is if you are a minor. But if you are an adult, you are not allowed.

There is a lot of negative impact, it is more like you are denied of the right of being treated as a minor and you have to prepare yourself to deal with the situation as an adult. Many times, it is difficult if they reject you automatically and you have to live a life of an adult and as an adult you are treated differently. As an adult migrant in Germany, especially in Bremen, you are going through different camps and these camp lives are really difficult and tough. There are a lot of difficulties and many times, you will have a transfer to leave Bremen. That means that you have to go out of Bremen which is very difficult for many of us as migrants if you are not accepted as a minor. If you go outside of Bremen to another city, then, in many occasions they decide to take you to different cities also. If you are unlucky, you end up being deported back to your country, because in Bremen people refuse to go out. In Bremen, you are a bit safe from deportation. For me, it is a very negative aspect of being rejected as a minor. It has a lot of negative impacts on me, and us minors, as black migrants, because it is very difficult to even have a school to go to. These schools that you have in the end are not normal schools, it is more like adult schools of learning the language. It has a lot of negative impacts and mentally, it has a lot of negative impacts on me, because there is also a lot of letters that you receive. It is more like — threatening.

In this room, there will be 5 beds here and there is no window, there is no oxygen. And the security — they don&#x27;t have a good attitude. They speak to you the way they want. You don&#x27;t have privacy in your room too. They can open your room anytime, even when you are sleeping or you are not there. <span class="emphasis-in-quote">It is like a prison cell</span>, that is what I am calling it.

People used to be frustrated and do a lot of stuff. I don&#x27;t think<em> Lindenstraße</em> is somewhere someone should live even one day. It is not different in a prison compared to <em>Lindenstraße</em>, especially in the Corona quarantine period.” Q: “How long did the quarantine in Lindenstraße in 2020 last?” A: “It was like one month in <em>Lindenstraße</em>, we had one-month quarantine.” Q: “One whole month?” A: “One month and you are not allowed to go out. Yeah, and their food is not even healthy, it is not good for even animal consumption. It is not good for human beings and they are giving those foods to people. It is bread and I don&#x27;t know how to call it — I just ate this food the time I came to <em>Lindenstraße.</em> But we just thank this association <em>Together we are Bremen</em> (<em>TWAB</em>). They provided a lot of stuff for us in this quarantine time. So we felt like we could just enjoy the moment. It was difficult for us, but we just enjoyed the moment that we are living. Especially, because the quarantine was in Ramadan. And Siaka and Suleyman and other people from <em>TWAB </em>helped us with cooking stuff and shopping. That&#x27;s why we had everything that we wanted in that quarantine moment. You just had to write <em>TWAB </em>what you want, and then it will be delivered to you. So we just thank <em>TWAB </em>for the support they have made. It was really making us grateful. We just spent one month of quarantine in that camp. But what would have happened if we did not have that help! I don&#x27;t think we would have made it even one week because it was Ramadan. People fast all day and they are not allowed to go out and buy stuff for themselves and you keep those people in one place. If it was not for their help, the camp would be — I don&#x27;t know, maybe we would not be here, sitting and talking. I don&#x27;t know what would have happened, because everyone would have been frustrated. And I don&#x27;t know what could happen, maybe something will happen, no one knows.

I don&#x27;t think it is only in <em>Lindenstraße,</em> it is all these camps. People are not allowed to do stuff, it is not good. People should not live even one day in those camps. It was really crazy. And then I went to<em> Zollhaus </em>last year.” Q: “<em>Zollhaus</em> — is that a camp or what is it?” A: “It is not different from <em>Lindenstraße</em>, but in this one, you live in your own room, you have your bath. But you don&#x27;t have your privacy, <span class="emphasis-in-quote">they open your room anytime they want.

And were you able to spend a time in<em> Lindenstraße</em> during the corona pandemic?” A: “Yeah, I was living there in corona pandemic. They came and test us and said, ‘You all are positive so you have to quarantine for like 2 weeks,’ so then we were there for 2 weeks for our quarantine.” Q: “I heard some had to do quarantine for a month, were you also part of the people who had to do quarantine for a month or more or did you just do your quarantine for 2 weeks?” A: “Our group was lucky enough. They just do only for 2 weeks but people who did their quarantine first time because we were the last group that had to be quarantined so I think that&#x27;s the reason we were lucky enough not to get one month but the first group went for like one month towards quarantine. Our group just got a two weeks quarantine, yeah we were lucky enough.” Q: “How was your living condition during quarantine? As you said, the food was not good and if you&#x27;re in quarantine you cannot get food for yourself, right? So how did you manage to...?” A: “Yeah, our quarantine in our group, we are lucky — that also came <em>exactly </em>in Ramadan — so we are lucky enough <em>Together We Are Bremen (TWAB) </em>everyday they cook and they bring food for us to break our fast, that food is a lot of food. So we are lucky enough during this Ramadan and this quarantine then, we didn&#x27;t eat their camp food because <em>TWAB</em> was there to support us with the food and they made us very good food so we are lucky enough to have those good food but not from the camp. The camp — their food is very bad so we cannot be doing Ramadan: fasting and eating that food at the same time, we will not survive, we will die.”</div>

              <div class="paragraph-light">Q: “Are you financially supported by the state?” A: “Now, no. Before yes, when I was in the camp, every month you receive — I do not know how much — but you receive a social benefit. But right now, no social benefit from the state because the problem is that I was asked to be transferred out of Bremen to a different city. I think this is around Hanover, it is called Bad Fallingbostel. It is a camp, then I refused to go to this place, because Bremen is where I want to live and I like it here in Bremen. I have a lot of friends here; so it is more like a home to me. I don&#x27;t want to go to any other village where I have never been to, and I know nobody there. Here, they tell you to integrate and I have done this by myself. I have been well-integrated here. <span class="emphasis-in-quote">I have been here for 2 years, I have been to school, I am almost doing my <em>B1</em> now, so why would I leave Bremen to another start?</span> This is the reason why I refused to go. They refused to give me any social benefit at the moment, and I do not have any health insurance card, like everybody else. So everything I have to do for myself. It is difficult, but I will stay true to it.” Q: “Do pay for any administration process? Do you self-pay the lawyers?” A: “Yes, I have to pay. Anything I am doing now is all by myself or the support I get from people, but from the state not at all.” Q: “And also, you don&#x27;t have access to food and health care?” A: “No access to health care, no access to social benefit, no access to any other help from the state. Only from the social workers: not from the <span data-tippy-content="When our interviewees speak of the Social, they often refer to the Youth Welfare Services." class="tooltip">Sozialamt</span>, but from the people who help us, friends or other non-political groups, but nothing from the state.” Q: “So how do you access healthcare when you get sick?” A: “That is difficult to access any healthcare at the moment. Many times, when I am sick I have to go to the private hospitals and pay. Some of them help. Some hospitals you pay a lot and there are also some humanitarian hospitals or clinics you can go to, but not all of them help. Many of those humanitarian places cannot help you on certain drugs, it is really difficult. I have spent money, for example, I had a toothache and that took a few weeks for me, so I had to fix these. I went to a private clinic and pay the <em>Zahnarzt</em> to help, and he removed it. Although it was expensive, there was no other way out.” Q: “After your minor age was rejected and then being transferred to another <span data-tippy-content="Bundes is the common reference of our interviewees to one of the camps in Bremen." class="tooltip">Bundesland</span>, staying now in Bremen, do you have any support of the society?” A: “From the society like?” Q: “Is there any kind of groups, people, friends, or any kind of help from the society in Bremen?” A: “Yes sure, I got a lot of help. When I was in the adult camp, I was also doing activism regarding migration, so I joined this group called <em>Together We Are Bremen (TWAB) </em>and we fought together, and we still fight together. Up to now, I still get a lot of support from this group, they are doing a lot for me in terms of financial issues and stuff like that and accommodation as well.”</div>

              <div class="paragraph-light">Q: “I can imagine how frustrating it is to go through one year of school — waking up everyday, every morning with all energy and everything and at the end of the day just for the last day for you to feel like yes this is <em>my </em>hard work and it&#x27;s time for me to achieve what I have been struggling for and then just out of the blue something just come out without basis just to stop you from getting there — it&#x27;s really hard. And I can imagine how painful that must have been. So, at the moment, you are not in the system, right?” A: “No.” Q: “So, how do you manage to survive? Because if you&#x27;re not in the system, it means you&#x27;re not having support from the society, let&#x27;s say, or the state. So how are you coping with this?” A: “Yeah, it is a very difficult situation because I don&#x27;t expect to come to Germany, to Europe, to be in this situation. I came here for a reason. So if I came into a country and you tell me that I&#x27;m illegal to live in your country and I don&#x27;t even know how can a human being be illegal? Because I leave my country to come into your country and you said I&#x27;m illegal. That&#x27;s the only reason. You said I will not have anything, you&#x27;ll not give me. I don&#x27;t need nothing from you — just tell me, ‘Look, you are here, you&#x27;re gonna stay here with us,’ and I don&#x27;t even need anybody. Just say, ‘Yeah, you can go to work.’ Just give me something but you said, ‘Nothing.’ You give me nothing and said, ‘You are illegal here.’ So, I&#x27;m thankful there is another group in Bremen which helps us. They give us money every week, yeah. So, I&#x27;m coping — small money, little money is not enough but yeah, I&#x27;m thanking god that — Alhamdulillah, that I&#x27;m getting little from there so that&#x27;s how I manage to survive. Yeah that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m coping because I&#x27;m illegally here, that&#x27;s why I cannot live here.” Q: “How is your living conditions because if you&#x27;re — its difficult to have living — or are you staying with your family?” A: “No, of course not. I&#x27;m living from one place to another like you get into — some people are moving from one place to another like every two weeks or every one month or two months.” [Q: Like just moving?] A: “Yeah, like someone who is having a house and he want to go for holidays or something for two weeks. So, when this person want to offer his house, you then go and stay there during his holidays so you will stay there sometime for one month, some for two months, sometime for two weeks or three weeks. So, that&#x27;s how you manage. If this person is gone so you can live in this house and then go to another house and finding a house is very difficult. So very very difficult, you know, very difficult. So that&#x27;s how we are managing the situation.” Q: “It&#x27;s like in the process you lost sense of belonging because you don&#x27;t know where—” A: “No no no no.” Q: “You don&#x27;t have even roof over your head to call your safe space?” A: “You don&#x27;t. <span class="emphasis-in-quote">Germans, they said like, human beings are illegal to live in their country with the one reason. They said I&#x27;m over age — I&#x27;m over 18. They decide that I&#x27;m over 18 and they said: ‘When you&#x27;re over 18, you cannot live here in Bremen so that means you are illegal.</span> So you cannot live here but if you wanna live here, that&#x27;s your own business.’ So you have to find a solution for yourself but they cannot take care of you.”</div>

When I came here, I went to <span data-tippy-content="Bundes is the common reference of our interviewees to one of the camps in Bremen." class="tooltip">Bundes</span>. It is a minor camp. Before I went there, I have some friends who took me there. They asked me, ‘How old are you?’ I said, ‘I&#x27;m 17.’ I was there and 3 months later they took me to an office, they asked me some questions about how I came to Europe and how I lived my life and other stuff. Later, in 2 weeks they said that I am 19 years old. I said, ‘That&#x27;s not my age,’ but they said, ‘That is what we decided.’ I asked them, ‘Can I bring evidence to show my real age?’ They said, ‘It does not work like that here, the only way we can accept that, is if we have any document from Europe.’ But if I have any other paper from Africa, they do not believe that, because so many people can make that. I don&#x27;t know how that works. If I asked some friends to get me my birth certificate I can get it, but they said no, I am 19, that is their decision and that&#x27;s it. They said that 19 is also good for me, I should not be worried about anything. It was difficult, but I see it as it is, I am in Europe, in Germany and I do not know how their system works. I am new here and I don&#x27;t want to have any problem with anybody here. There is nothing I can do. I asked, ‘What I can do to fight this age? Because I don&#x27;t want it, I want my real age.’ They said that I can take a lawyer and do an appeal. This is what they told me. So, later I got a transfer to a big camp, there is like, maybe 300 to 400 people. I stayed 7 to 8 months there, they gave me a lawyer to fight my case, so I went to the first court that is only for younger age and they accepted my age as 17. But they said that it is not enough evidence to give me my real age. They will have to forward it to another case, they have to go to another court. It is like, 2 courts have to decide that. The first is the younger courts, they have different names, the second one is the bigger one, that makes the last decision. If they say 17, then they will accept it. I waited almost a year, I was going to school, I was playing football and that is it, another day, you know.”</div>

              <div class="paragraph-light">“I want to think about the notion that the system is robbing our time. L. formulated it like this in one of our interviews. I first want to talk about the change of paths. Because the time is short, you have to change paths, you know. Maybe when you come to Europe you have this plan or this dream of what you want to do, but because your time is wasted in this system you have to change your path and you have to change what you want to do. Because that system is robbing our time. So, who is this system as a robber? It robs our time, for example, because we have to use our time for legal fights. There is all that time that you need to fight, to go to lawyers, and for all these things that you have to do. The bone test, for example. Also, transfers take a lot of time. Because it is not like you come here today and then immediately all the legal issues are settled and immediately you are settling in the place that you wish to stay at. Rather, it will take one year before you know. It will also take months before you get transferred to the place that the system wants you to settle at. It will take months until you have the chance to even do the bone test, and then you have to wait for the result. And then there is the time that you spend out of the system, you know. This time is also wasted because you cannot work on your future. And then there is also the time before you get out of the system, you know, the initial time when you tried to register as a minor and waited for the results, when you did the legal fights and everything. That is all time that is taken from your life. And then you get out of the system. And then there is the time living in camps, you know. I think that is very important, all the time that people spend in the camps, all the months, or years, you know. And this time robbery also affects schooling, education, and opportunities. When you are waiting for your results, fighting legal fights, or are out of the system, you can either not attend a school or it&#x27;s harder to focus at school because of all that insecurity. This is a violation of our fundamental rights because they deny us opportunities. I feel like this is a violation. One of the time robber&#x27;s main tools is bureaucracy. Yeah, I think most of our time is wasted on bureaucracy. Going from office to office. I think it is making people go crazy. So, I think it should be called <em>bureaucrazy</em>. And there is also the process and the laws that denied us to live these dreams here. That also relates to the problem of time. It is like a process that you have to undergo. You have to go and make interviews, go for the test, and all this: these are processes. But it is not only about processes. There are also laws that force people, they have to support these things that you have to do. All of that is connected to all these processes that rob our time. It all comes down to a denial — of our time, of our opportunities, of our rights.”</div>

He couldn&#x27;t attend school, he was either super tired or maybe he was taking something, I don&#x27;t know.

Were you stressed out, were you depressed? Did you see any psychologist and how did you get access, who helped you out?” A: “Yes, I do, because it was really sad, that I cannot defend myself. They are in control, they control me — that is the way I can say it. I said, ‘I can bring my birth certificate.’ They said that they do not need it. Even if I bring it, their decision is their decision. This is how they told me. This really disturbed me, because I have my school papers, and I cannot bring them because the age they gave me is different from my certificate. If I bring it here, it could cause me problems. If I have to go to school or do some course, and I tell them that I did this course and I want to just continue, they have to ask me to start again. The reason is, if I can bring some other documents and show that I did it, but I cannot do it, because if I do it, it shows I have a different age, that I am not the same person. It really disturbs me. I got stressed. I cannot sleep, I wake up in the morning with headache, I go to the hospital. Everyday I am at the hospital, I have too many pains. I don&#x27;t even understand, I have never got sick like this. I have a lot of depression, sometimes my psychologist even gets tired of me. (...) I was really tired, I have stomach pain, I have headache sometimes, there was a day I even passed out. It was a really sad situation, I couldn&#x27;t do nothing, what they decide that is it. They just ask you questions, you answer it, but they make their own — they just say what they want to say. It is like, you ask me questions, I answer them, but you do not care about my answers. This is how I feel, this is how I think they do it. My psychologist tried, she is a lady and she helped me a lot. She advised me a lot, she helped me write some letters, to try to show my lawyer, that I am really sick, that they need to help me. Where I stay, the food is not good, they have to get me out there, to stay in a better situation, but it takes time. At least, time goes on, it changes step by step.”</div>
